This is a collection of notes regarding the project. This is meant to be an informal file that
documents learning and thought process. This is almost a form of a digital logbook for the project.

    This project developed out of an interest in automated Monte Carlo simulations. Their may be existing solutions
    on the web, however this is intended to be a learning experience for myself. This also provided a new challenge
    for my programming skills. I will be looking to implement new to me methods and techniques. I would like for this to
    be both automated and scalable, however right now a working model is needed.

    Completed - Start of code
    Lessons Learned - The derivative of the cumulative sum is the count
    Future progress - Find a way around the derivative gap

    Given last nights learnings, a simple test of whether the culmative sum is line has been created. Well the framwork has
    I am looking for a way to automate this. I have a few ideas that I will try out.

    Beta has been created to loop the code. Functions should be explored in the future. However this inefficent solution
    of Beta provided a rapid solution to protyping and only changing one unknown (technique/process) at a time

    The r^2 method of comparing the culmative sum to a a line appears to be a valid first attempt. Further testing is needed.

    Charlie was skipped

    Delta is the original autonomous version
