This is a collection of notes regarding the project. This is meant to be an informal file that
documents learning and thought proccess. This is almost a form of a digital logbook for the project.

    This project developed out of an interest in automated Monte Carlo simulations. Their may be existing solutions
    on the web, however this is intended to be a learning experience for myself. This also provided a new challenge
    for my programming skills. I will be looking to implement new to me methods and techniques. I would like for this to
    be both automated and scalable, however right now a working model is needed.

    Completed - Start of code
    Lessons Learned - The derivative of the cumulative sum is the count
    Future progress - Find a way around the derivative gap

    Given last nights learnings, a simple test of whether the culmative sum is line has been created. Well the framwork has
    I am looking for a way to automate this. I have a few ideas that I will try out.
